Programming basics - Classpath
--------------------------------
1. What is a process and what is a thread? 

A process is a execution of a program.
It is controlled by process controll block.

thread is a unit of a process.
needs of threads:
	using all the cores in CPU
	multi threading
thread can be created by extending thread class or implementing runnable interface.

RT: while using a MS word.. typing sentence is a thread and spell check is another thread both works parallelly



-------------------------------------------------------------
2. Open Task Manager and observer the running processes and its attributes like  process ID,
 memory used, CPU used, disk usage, network usage and number of threads. And understand what these numbers mean.

CPU - the mathematical ability of the computer
MEMORY - RAM, temporary, fast
DISK - the speed of reading and writing data from hard drive
NETWORK - computers ability to communicate over network based on network card(the port where data is sent in and out to internet)
GPU - graphics card



-------------------------------------------------------------
3. What are Environmental Variables? Significance of PATH variables 

Envi variable is those whose value is set outside teh program
i.e operating system
Each variable has NAME=value
NAME will be uppercase, value will be string
any number of envi avriables can be created and used at any point of time.
primary use is to limit the need of modifying and re-releasing app due to changes in config data.

PATH specifies set of dir where executable codes are located
PATH contains string of dir separated by semicolon




-------------------------------------------------------------
4. Difference between 32 bit and 64 bit applications

32bit system - 32 bit address represenattion - 2^32 memory addresses - 4GB
64bit system - 64 bit address representation - 2^64 memry addressses - 16 EXAbytes



-------------------------------------------------------------
5. Write a small java program (say a "Hello World" program) and put it in a directory.
 Compile the program and change directory to some other directory and try to execute the class file (This will help
 you to learn about setting PATH/CLASSPATH variables!).

 set CLASSPATH=C:\Users\Yasin\javapr\s1_q5\temp



-------------------------------------------------------------
6. Write a java program to print the size of different data types in
 java (list all the data types!).

primitive datatyes - byte, char, short, int, long, float, double
non primitive - String, Arrays, class


-------------------------------------------------------------
7. Write a program to read Input data from command line.



-------------------------------------------------------------
8. Write a class with a package statement in it and try to run it.




-------------------------------------------------------------
9. Write two classes (say "A" and "B") , in class "A" create an instance of class "B".
 Compile class "A" in some directory "D1" and class "B" in "D2" , now A.class and B.
class are in two separate directories. Try to run class "A" from directory "D1" 
(it will say class "B" not found). If you set classpath to both directories then 
it will work (try it out!)
10. Set the classpath from the class "A" itself (instead of specifying the classpath
 in the DOS shell , try to set in in your java program!)
11. Try to learn the difference between String and StringBuffer classes by
 writing small programs.
12. Write java program to reverse a string using StringBuffer class (do not 
use String class for data manipulation!)

Access Specifiers
1. Learning about access specifiers (Write java programs to bring about the difference 
between , public ,private,package and protected specifiers!) 
2. What is the meaning of declaring a class public? (try this by putting the class 
in a package and try to access the class from a different package!).
3. Learning about scope specifiers also what is the difference between instance variable 
and class variable? Write programs and try using local scope/method scope/member scope
 variables and how to access them.
4. Write a java program to print the system properties (Hint : Refer to System class) 
Try to print the current working directory from you java program.
5. Is the method main belong to any class? , if not why? , if so what are the access
 privileges to that method?
6. Is it possible to have a private class? (write a class and try it out! , 
try protected also!)
7. Is it possible to have a private constructor? (write a class and try it out! ) , 
if possible how do you create an instance of it from another class?
8. What is the meaning of declaring a variable "static" ? (write a program to bring
 out the difference between instance and class variables).
9. What is the meaning of declaring a method "static" ? how do you invoke such a method ?
10. What is the meaning of declaring a class static?
11. What is the meaning of declaring a class final?
12. How do you prevent overriding of a method (can you prevent overloading of a method?)
13. What are inner classes and anonymous classes? Why they are used?
14. Is there any difference between an inner class and nested class?

Advanced Concepts
1. Convert a float value to an integer (float to double etc.) (Hint use wrapper 
classes, do not typecast them!).
2. Function overriding & overloading ( Write a set of classes to bring out the difference!)
3. Write a class and override "toString" method in the class object. 
(When you write a class "A" does it have any parent? , investigate!).
4. What is an abstract class , why it is used ? (Write an abstract and try to use it!).
5. Write an interface and try to bring out diff. between abstract class and an interface!
 (can I define variables in interfaces?)
6. What is the difference between a Hashtable and Properties? 
(Write a program as an example!)
7. Write a program to print all elements in a Properties object (Using Enumeration!)
8. Can you remove an element while enumerating through a Properties object? 
(If so how? If not how will i remove a element while enumerating!)
9. How to you catch an exception? Write a program to catch a NullPointerException!
10. How do you throw an exception?
11. What is the difference between an Error and an Exception?
12. In java are the parameters passed by reference or by value 
(Write a program to test for basic data types , arrays ,strings ,string arrays and custom objects !)

I/O Operations
1. Bring out differences between char streams and byte streams.
2. What is the format of char data type and why it is platform independent?
3. How do you convert char streams to byte streams.
4. Write a program to read from a lengthy string (using streams) 
and write the output to a file.
5. Write a program to redirect your print statements (System.out and System.err) 
to two files stdout.txt and stderr.txt.
6. Write a program to read a text file (using byte streams) 
convert the bytes to chars and print the output.
7.Write a program to get the result for the following
    In a school(1-10),each class is maintaining a file having data about all 
the students in a format (Roll###Name###Age###phone).Principal want to generate a 
file containing data of all the students who is above 10 years old in a 
format(Name##Age##phone##class)
